# AI Lab 3: Iambic Pentameter (Part 2)

**Due:** 11/5 (not 10/31)

In PE4 you thought about how you might write a scansion program, or tell an AI how to scan. For this Lab, you will explore both LLM's self-representation of what they know about meter, and their ability to scan it. Do both sections.

## First Section: Testing LLM Knowledge of Meter

Choose an AI chatbot that allows you to upload files (Clarity, Claude, most of them now). In a prompt dialogue of no more than 3 questions, try to figure out what this LLM knows, or thinks it knows, or says it does not know, about poetic meter. The terms you choose matter a lot. Will you ask about meter in general, iambic meter, "blank verse," or something else? Do you need to clarify as you prompt? If things get confusing don't be afraid to start over.

## Second Section: Testing LLM Scanning Ability

Upload a text (as .txt, .rtf, .docx) to the chatbot. About a page long, and it can be either poetry or prose. See if it can find and scan metrical lines or patterns. For example:

Next, evaluate its performance. Feel free to ask it what it did! For example, Clarity offered to write a python program to scan meter, but then informed me that: "Metrical analysis for iambic pentameter in a prose text is quite complex because it's not naturally structured to fit such patterns rigorously. The algorithmic approach used might not detect nuanced stresses and syllabic structures."
