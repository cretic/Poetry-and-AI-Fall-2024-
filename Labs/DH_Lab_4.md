# DH Lab 4: Research and Adapt an Existing Tool

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cretic/Poetry-and-AI-Fall-2024-/blob/main/DH_Lab_4.ipynb)

We've already done a ton of work this semester talking about different elements of code, various packages you can use, and tinkering with other people's code. Now, we are going to use DH Lab 4 to get a start on our final project. If you already have an idea feel free to explore it here. Or, if you don't have an idea yet, use this as a jumping off point!

## Available Tools and Packages

As a reminder, here are some of the packages/tools we have already learned about:

* Poesy
* Prosodic
* CMUDICT
* NLTK (Natural Language toolkit)
* word2vec / google news vectors

If you need a reminder on any of these tools, feel free to revisit past coding samples and labs. You can find all the code we have used in "CODE REPOSITORY" in the Google Drive.

## Your Task

Your task is to research an existing tool, and adapt it. If you already have a final project idea, this is a great opportunity to find code that already exists to work off of (and maybe get an additional idea you didn't think of at first!) If you don't have a final project idea yet, this is a great chance to see what is out there and see if it sparks any ideas for you.

## Where to Find Tools

Some places you may find an existing tool:

* Github
* Stack Overflow
* The tools we have already learned about
* Googling
* Asking AI
* The footnotes and github pages from articles (co-poet; Walsh et al.)

You should focus on tools that have the potential to change / analyze or otherwise contribute to poetry in the ways we have discussed in class.

Remember, if you need help or have any questions, you can always email madeline.gupta@yale.edu.

## Questions to Answer
