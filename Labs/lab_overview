Labs

The main engine of the course are our labs. 

These are intended to take about an hour, but that may vary based on your experience, and some may require additional trial and error or assistance from our course UTA.

They scale up in complexity as the semester progresses, building on previous work. 
Several labs have two parts: first, an exploration of an element of poetry using poems and theories of poetry, then interacting with or building a digital tool or AI to explore that element further. 
Some of the more complex labs (concerning enjambment and LLM training) will be group projects. 

I will upload the other labs as jupyter notebooks (best opened with colab)
